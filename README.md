🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
I have managed to create a guestbook page, that allows user to leave a name and message.  This was done through vs code.  Furthermore, I have created, client, server and database.  Utilised Render.com, Github to save my coding.  In additions to that I have managed to check for errors that were stopping Render from deploying. 

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
I was unable to achieve a stretch goal also, I have gad issues with render.com not deploying. 

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks
I found that my misspelling have let me down when writing my codes and I probably need to practice more as coding is something entirely new to me.
